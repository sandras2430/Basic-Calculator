# Basic-Calculator

A sleek, responsive, and fully functional basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental web development concepts and dynamic user interface manipulation.

Features

Dynamic Display: The calculator's screen content intelligently scales its font size to fit within the display area, preventing overflow and ensuring readability for long equations.

Dual Input Support: Use either the on-screen buttons (via mouse clicks) or your keyboard for a seamless user experience.

Clear and Reset: C and CE buttons to clear the current entry or reset the entire calculation.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structural layout of the calculator.

CSS3: For styling the interface and implementing a modern design.

JavaScript (ES6): For handling all the calculator's logic, from processing inputs to evaluating expressions and managing the responsive display.
